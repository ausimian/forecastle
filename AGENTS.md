# Forecastle

Build-time support for hot-code upgrades in Elixir releases. Forecastle is the
build-time half of a pair: [Castle](https://github.com/ausimian/castle) is the
runtime half. Consumers depend on Castle, which pulls Forecastle in as a
build-time dependency — Forecastle is not intended to be taken directly.

## What it does

`Forecastle.steps/1` wraps a Mix release's `:steps` list, injecting a
`pre_assemble` and `post_assemble` hook around `:assemble`:

- **`pre_assemble/1`** — strips runtime configuration and config providers out
  of the release (stashing them under the `Forecastle` key in `release.options`)
  and adds a `:preboot` boot script that starts `:sasl`, `:compiler`, `:elixir`
  and `:castle`.
- **`post_assemble/1`** — replays the stashed config providers into
  `sys.config`, renames `sys.config` to `build.config`, writes `bin/castle`,
  appends the Castle integration to the generated `env.sh`, and copies
  `runtime.exs`, the `.rel` file and any `relup` into the release.

The renaming and provider-stashing exist so that Castle, at runtime, controls
configuration evaluation rather than the standard Mix launcher.

`bin/<name>` is left exactly as Mix generated it. Everything Forecastle needs
around it composes instead:

- `bin/castle` is a thin wrapper that shells back through
  `bin/<name> rpc "Castle.<command>(...)"`, so it inherits cookie handling,
  distribution and node naming from the standard launcher. Most commands
  `exec` the launcher and are done; `install` and the version-less `commit`
  cannot, because they have something to do afterwards, so they capture the
  output and propagate the status themselves. What `install` does afterwards is
  confirm, through `Castle.running/1`, that the version it installed is the one
  running: `release_handler` replies as soon as it has accepted an upgrade,
  which for a transition that restarts the emulator is before the upgrade has
  run, and the reply may not outlive the reboot it triggers. A lost connection
  is therefore inconclusive rather than fatal — recognised as the launcher's
  whole `--rpc-eval … :noconnection` diagnostic at the start of a line, never as
  the bare word, which is a usable release version and turns up in the messages
  that name a version that failed — which is also why `validate_vsn` refuses
  control characters, since a version carrying a newline could otherwise forge
  that line for itself.

  The install's two streams are captured apart, for different purposes: its
  standard error is what the classifier reads and is passed through to standard
  error, while its standard output is held until the confirmation succeeds. So
  the success stream never carries a claim the confirmation goes on to disprove,
  and a warning the launcher wrote never comes back out on the wrong stream. The
  confirmations are split the same way, and their standard error is passed on
  even when they succeed — a warning is worth no less for arriving as the upgrade
  is being declared good. Do not merge either with `2>&1`; merging cannot be
  undone.

  Everything able to stop the script is settled before the launcher is invoked:
  the timeout, the clock (`date +%s` is not a conversion POSIX requires, so a
  system can have a `date` that will not answer), and a capture directory, which
  `install` claims for itself under `RELEASE_TMP` with `mkdir` under `umask 077`
  — atomic, so it fails rather than following a symlink someone else planted at
  the name, and private, so nothing inside can be swapped between one open and
  the next. Keep that ordering — past the install the system is on another
  release, so stopping from there leaves it unconfirmed with nothing said about
  it. Four separate review findings have been that same shape.

  `CASTLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT` bounds the retrying, as a deadline in elapsed time
  rather than a count of attempts, measured against the system clock — so a
  correction to that clock mid-wait moves it, which is a footnote in the release
  notes rather than something to engineer around; POSIX shell has no monotonic
  clock. It does not bound an individual call: `:erpc` waits indefinitely, so a
  hard limit has to come from outside. A wrong cookie or an already-dead node is
  indistinguishable from a reboot and so is asked about until the deadline; that
  is deliberate, and called out in the release notes.

  Do not add signal forwarding or process reaping to make an interrupt stop the
  upgrade: it cannot. `Kernel.CLI` reaches the node through
  `:erpc.call`, which uses `spawn_request` with `{reply, error_only}` and
  `monitor` and **no link** (`erpc.erl:305`), so the remote worker is never
  signalled when the caller goes away — and OTP's own `spawn_request_abandon/1`
  documentation says only the `link` option would send an exit signal to an
  abandoned child. Beneath that, `:release_handler.install_release/1` is a
  `gen_server:call` (`release_handler.erl:1231`), and the upgrade runs inside
  that server's `handle_call`, which completes whether or not the caller is
  still there. Interrupting `bin/castle install` therefore stops the waiting,
  not the upgrade; the release note says so, and points at `bin/castle
  releases` for finding out where the system got to.
- The `env.sh` fragment expands `build.config` into `sys.config` in a preboot
  VM, for the commands that boot the system. It is appended, so a project's own
  `rel/env.sh.eex` survives and runs first.
- Version selection needs no code at all: `release_handler` writes the
  committed version to `releases/start_erl.data`, which is where the standard
  launcher already reads `RELEASE_VSN` from.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/forecastle.ex` | Release step hooks (the whole of the build-time logic) |
| `lib/mix/tasks/compile/appup.ex` | `:appup` compiler — evaluates the file named by the `:appup` project key and writes `<app>.appup` into `ebin` |
| `lib/mix/tasks/forecastle.relup.ex` | `mix forecastle.relup` — wraps `:systools.make_relup/4` |
| `priv/castle.sh.eex` | EEx template for `bin/castle`, the release management CLI |
| `priv/env.sh.eex` | EEx template for the fragment appended to the release's `env.sh` |
| `test/fixtures/sample` | A real application, assembled by the test suite into a real release |
| `test/support` | The workspace the fixture is built in, and the case template for tests that build it |

## Working on this project

- Run `mix precommit` before committing. It is the single validation gate —
  `compile --warnings-as-errors`, `deps.unlock --unused`, `format`,
  `credo --strict`, `test --include e2e`. Do not run the individual checks
  piecemeal.
- `@version` in `mix.exs` is the single source of truth for the version.
- Add user-visible changes to `RELEASE.md` on the feature branch, using
  [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) sections. Do not defer release
  notes to release time, and exclude internal CI/lint churn.
- Release with `mix publisho <patch|minor|major>`, which bumps `@version`, folds
  `RELEASE.md` into `CHANGELOG.md` at the `<!-- %% CHANGELOG_ENTRIES %% -->`
  placeholder, commits and tags. Tags are bare semver — no `v` prefix. Pushing
  a tag triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which publishes to Hex.
- Never commit directly to `main`; work on a feature branch and open a PR.

## Tests

The suite works by building the fixture application in `test/fixtures/sample`
into a real release, in a workspace under `_build/fixtures`. Delete that
directory to start from a clean slate.

| Suite | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `test/forecastle_test.exs` | The step functions, against a synthetic `Mix.Release` |
| `test/forecastle/assembly_test.exs` | The assembled tree, including `bin/<name>` being byte-identical to the launcher plain Mix produces |
| `test/forecastle/castle_cli_test.exs` | `bin/castle` as a shell script, against a launcher stub that records its arguments |
| `test/forecastle/upgrade_test.exs` | Booting a release and hot-upgrading it, tagged `:e2e` |

The `:e2e` suite is excluded by default and included by `mix precommit`. Run it
on its own with `mix test --include e2e`. It needs no epmd daemon: the fixture
configures distribution without one.

## Known limitations

- **Windows is not supported.** Configuration is expanded at boot by the
  `env.sh` integration and there is no `env.bat` counterpart, so a `.bat`
  launcher looks for a `sys.config` nothing creates. Assembly warns. Real
  support is a feature, not a fix.
- **Root scripts do not update through a hot upgrade.** `release_handler`
  extracts with `keep_old_files`, so `bin/<release>` and `bin/castle` are
  whatever the deployment was first built with. New files do appear, so a
  migrating deployment gains `bin/castle`, but keeps its old launcher. Mix's own
  launcher has always behaved this way; do not add a dispatcher to work around
  it without deciding that question for `bin/<release>` too.
- **The emulator-restart transitions are unproven.** `bin/castle install`
  handles them, and each branch of that handling is tested against a launcher
  stub, but nothing can build a relup that asks for one until
  [#4](https://github.com/ausimian/forecastle/issues/4), so the `:e2e` suite
  only covers the hot-upgrade path.
- **Concurrent boots race on `sys.config`.** `Castle.generate/1` writes into
  the version directory, so per-invocation config files aren't reachable from
  here. Fixed on Castle's side by
  [castle#13](https://github.com/ausimian/castle/issues/13), which materialises
  the target configuration in a `:peer`.

Do not work the last one around in this repo: putting Castle's logic back into
shell-embedded Elixir is the coupling `bin/castle` exists to remove.

## Compatibility

Forecastle manipulates `Mix.Release` internals and the layout Mix generates, so
it is sensitive to changes in Elixir's release tooling. The CI matrix runs the
whole suite, `:e2e` included, across Elixir 1.18–1.20 and OTP 27–29 to catch
that early.
